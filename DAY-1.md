The main character `They` is doing something in a small dark apartment. 

THe beginning scene shows different cuts showing They's hands and arms using brightly colored bottles, measuring, and putting drops of the bottles liquid into a glass container. It plays a midi score -> Mario 64 soundfont rendition of Smashing Pumpkin's "Spaceboy". 

It shows They looking at their phone for information, numbers, and measurements. Weighing checking the figures, and dropping drops of the liquid into the larger container. It doesn't show They's face clearly just barely being cut off. In the background of the shots it makes it clear that this is sparse apartment, very poorly lit. The only thing of substance is the neatly organized bottles. The bootles are plastic with stickers showing different fruits, spices, candies, desserts, with bold generic titles such as TFA Sweet Cream, FA Gala, TFA Butterscotch. 

The song completes with the ending creshendo of the song ending in sequence with a close up of inside They's refrigerator. Inside is a handful of staple items, but generally empty. Maybe a quart of milk cardboard container, eggs, and clearly in focus is a very large glass vial bottle with a clearly purposely large Mr. Yuck sticker centered on it. The camera zooms closer into it very slowly as the song finishes, They closes the fridge door, and it gently closes, in the background you can see They walk into darkness to the left and the song ends and fades out. 

The dark room goes to black when the light flicks off and fades out abruptly. The screen shows in large white thin lettering "APARTMENT SIMULATOR"

## DAY 1

An instance shot of They's face, their eyes are shut facing upwards in bed asleep. The camera shows the face being upside down. The camera moves upward with a very silght rotation correcting their face to be rightside up in the picture. The user hears clanking and distant muttering and muttering. They's eyes open wide and cock to the side. Looking for the source of this noise.

The camera jumps back to the rear of the apartment, from the darkness it's too far to make out what's being done but it's clear that somebody is in the front of the apartment. They walks towards them until it's made clear they know this person. 

DIALOG:

"Hello?"

The camera flips showing They in the left of the frame, in the very close foreground, unfocused and cut off you can see the edge of "the person". 

"y- y- w- wh- I didn't see your car parked. I was fixing the radiator. I'll do this another time."

The person leaves, They is alone in the apartment in the kitchen. 

The camera is facing the kitchen refrigerator for the remainder of the game.

*player control is now replaced*

You can navigate around the apartment. If you select different items in the apartment you get flavor text but you really can't do anything. The only option for actual action is going to your bed which is on the floor in the bedroom and it asks you "Watch videos on your phone?"

Options:

* looking at the ejuice flavorings: "I've already filled all my bottles. I have to wait for them to steep long enough."
* Looking at the large back lit projector tv, "There's a dead bug smashed in the top right. It's been there for years, I wish it would just fall. I could play my 360, but it's still only got the same couple games. I guess I could hook up my computer and play the roms and emulators I've got, I don't think I'm in the mood though."
* Looking at the pc sitting on the couch: "I haven't used this for years. I've saved a lot of money on not having to pay for internet."
* Looking at the toilet. I'm not sure why this yellow appears on the walls, it's like somebodies secretly smoking in here every day. I guess I'll just keep cleaning it, hopefully it'll go away."
* Looking at the refrigerator: "I'm not hungry. Tacebell sounds nice though. I wonder what they might have for three dollars."
* Looking at the sink: "All clean. I only have a few dishes, I'm glad I can keep that together at least."
